Random Quote Generator

A simple web application that displays a random quote each time a button is clicked. It is built to practice basic frontend development and JavaScript logic.

The project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for generating and displaying random quotes.

To run the project, clone the repository and open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

The project structure consists of index.html, style.css, and script.js.

This project can be extended by adding features like a copy quote option, dark mode, quote categories, or API-based quotes.
